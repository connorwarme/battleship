// implement improved tactics for AI player

// target mode: after hit, return adjacent squares and attack those
// target improved: if multiple hits are horizontal, prefer continued attacks along horizontal until sunk

// hunt mode (random) improved: only attack every other square (while patrol boat exists)
// -> then every 3rd, etc.
// utilizing math concept of parity, based on (shortest) ship's length
